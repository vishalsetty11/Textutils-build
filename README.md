# Textutils-build
Textutils is built using function-based components using Reactjs.

this is the build version of the textutils app, was experimenting how build works.

The link 'https://vishalsetty11.github.io/Textutils/' would show 'Error 404' beacuse we have used 'react-router-dom' and git dosn't support router-dom.

So, I have hosted Textutils on 'https://textutils-build.vercel.app' using Vercel.
